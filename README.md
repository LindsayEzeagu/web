## This project was created to practice coding using Javascript , HTML and CSS 


### Maintainablity 

A module should be self-contained and if well-designed creates less dependencies on the rest of the codebase. Updating a single module is much simpler whern decoupled from other pieces of code. Eg a brand new skincare routine should not interfere with turining off the lights. 

### Reusablity

During the HTML/CSS unit you heard about DRY (don't repeat yourself), so we can definiately reuse brush teet, do some sort of skincare and sort out hair.
